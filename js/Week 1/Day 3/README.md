# 5.1 - Country to live in

1. Create a function called ‘countryToLiveIn’ that takes 4 parameters:
   `language`, `isIsland`, `population` and `country`.

isIsland’s argument value should be true or false. population’s argument
valueshould be an integer. country should be a string of a country. Language
should be a string.

2. Let's say Sarah is looking for a new country to live in. She wants to live in
   a country that speaks English, has less than 50 million people and is not an
   island.

3. Write an if statement inside your function to help Sarah figure out if your
   country is right for her. You will need to write a condition that accounts
   for all of Sarah's criteria. Take your time with this, and check part of the
   solution if necessary.

4. If yours is the right country, log a string like this: 'You should live in
   Finland. If not, log 'Finland does not meet your criteria'.

5. If your country does not meet all the criteria, go back and temporarily
   change some argument values in order to make the condition true.
