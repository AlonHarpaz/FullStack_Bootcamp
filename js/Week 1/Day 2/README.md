# 3.3 - Declarations vs Expressions

1. The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration
   called 'percentageOfWorld1' which receives a 'population' value, and returns
   the percentage of the world population that the given population represents.
   For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of the world
   population.
2. To calculate the percentage, divide the given 'population'value by 7900 and
   then multiply by 100.
3. Call 'percentageOfWorld1' for 3 populations of countries of your choice,
   store the results into variables, and log them to the console.
4. Create a function expression which does the exact same thing, called
   'percentageOfWorld2', and also call it with 3 country populations (can be the
   same populations)
