# 12.1 - Fun with Reduce

Write the following functions using the reduce built-in function.

1. max
2. sum of even numbers
3. average

# 13.1 - Loops in loops

Have this array of array’s of neighbouring countries: const listOfNeighbours = [
["Canada", "Mexico"], ["Spain"], ["Norway", "Sweden", "Russia"], ];

With the use of two for loops, console log all the countries one by one and in
your terminal. You should see something like this in your terminal:
Neighbour:Canada

Neighbour: Mexico

Neighbour: Spain

Neighbour: Norway

Neighbour: Sweden

Neighbour: Russia

# 13.2 - While Loop

1. Recreate the challenge from the exercise 6.4- looping_with_arrays ,but this
   time using a while loop.

- Create an array containing 4 population values of 4 countries of your choice.
  Store this array into a variable called 'populations'
- Create a function called ‘populationPercentages’ that takes the population
  array as an argument.
- Inside the function, create an empty array called ‘percentages’.
- Use a for loop to iterate over the population array you received as an
  argument..
- On each iteration use the function we created earlier (module 3,
  ex.3.3-declarations vs expressions) for each element of the array.
- Push the result to the ‘percentages’ array.
- Return from the function the ‘percentages’ array.

2. Reflect on what solution you like better for this task: the for loop or the
   while loop?
