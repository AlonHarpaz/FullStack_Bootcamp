# 10.1 - map vs forEach

You are getting an array of objects of the recent video releases fromyour
database.(array below). We only care about the portion of datawe are getting.

1. Create a function that will loop over the array with the forEach method.
   Return from the function an array of objects. Each object will contain the id
   and name of the specific movie.

2. Create another function that will do the same thing expect now use the map
   method.
