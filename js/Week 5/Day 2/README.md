# 17.3 - Selecting all elements

You have these elements in your html file:

<div id="myFirstDiv"></div>
<div id="mySecondDiv"></div>
<div id="myThridDiv"></div>
<div id="myFourthDiv"></div>

Somebody selected the elements and stored them into individual variables like
this:

const myFirstDiv = document.querySelector("#myFirstDiv");

const mySecondDiv = document.querySelector("#mySecondDiv");

const myThirdDiv = document.querySelector("#myThirdDiv");

const myFourthDiv = document.querySelector("#myFourthDiv");

Is there a better way you can store the individual elements with giving them
different names?
